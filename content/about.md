:heart:
My name is Sofia Popova. Also known as Sophie, Nasty Bohemia, Sofia Hot Sauce, and Pururum.

I express myself through art and development of new technologies. You may consider me a digital artist as I engage in the architecture of systems, cyber security, and web development.
One of my first interests as a kid was storytelling. I started by writing comics and small news features for my family.
Screenwriting laid my carrier in film. And now, for over a decade in the film industry, I have experienced being a producer, video editor, colorist, film director, and screenwriter. During this time, I created over three hundred video works.
After school, I acquired a technical background in IT with system, network & database administration, full-stack & blockchain development, cloud & quantum computing, penetration testing & cybersecurity. All this knowledge led me to build products and learn more about business, marketing, and sales. Through the business side, I have learned the importance of research, planning, and execution. I am now looking to use my knowledge to help others achieve their goals, and my dedication is to make the world a better place.
