## FEARS OF STORING DATA IN THE CLOUD
Cloud computing can be an excellent opportunity for businesses, but it also introduces a new set of risks like data loss, unauthorized access, data theft, and malicious attacks. Organizations transitioning to the cloud could have some security and privacy concerns. 
The fear of running workloads in "someone else's data centers" is widespread, with many businesses and organizations concerned about the potential risks associated with such a task. This fear is understandable, as it often involves placing sensitive data and operations within the hands of a third party, which may sometimes have different levels of security and reliability than an organization would otherwise be able to provide for itself.
Furthermore, the potential for data breaches and other security issues is always a risk when outsourcing such operations. Companies must thoroughly vet any third-party data centers to ensure that they have the proper security protocols and processes in place to ensure that their data remains safe and secure.
Organizations should also take the time to consider their internal security measures and how these measures can be used to reduce the risks associated with outsourcing workloads to third-party data centers. These measures include setting up proper authentication and authorization systems and implementing encryption and other security protocols.
Running workloads in "someone else's data centers" is a risk. Still, with the proper security protocols and processes in place, organizations can protect themselves and their data from potential threats.
## BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD
Most cloud services provide a more secure environment than organizations' own data centers. Cloud providers have invested heavily in technology and personnel security to ensure that the data stored in their cloud environments are safe and secure. They also have in-depth knowledge of security best practices, allowing them to identify and respond to potential threats quickly.
On the other hand, organizations' own data centers often lack the resources necessary to implement robust security measures. Data centers may not have the personnel or technology to detect and respond to threats promptly, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Additionally, organizations can become overwhelmed with the sheer volume of data they need to protect, leading to security gaps and exploitation.
Overall, the cloud provides a more secure environment than organizations' own data centers due to the advanced security measures cloud providers have in place and their expertise in security best practices.
## OVERCOMING FEARS
By taking a proactive approach to learning security, organizations can ensure that their data is safe and secure in the cloud. Each public cloud vendor tends to have its own authorized classes. Below we will cover some tools you must get familiar with when working with the cloud services by Amazon, Microsoft, or Google.
AWS provides multiple services and features to help secure your applications and data. These include:
* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)
* Security Groups
* Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* Encryption
* Logging
* AWS Shield for DDoS protection
* Amazon Inspector for vulnerability scanning
* AWS Config for resource compliance
* AWS Certificate Manager for managing SSL/TLS certificates
IAM enables you to create users, manage permissions, and control access to your resources. You can also use IAM to create policies that govern user access.
VPCs provide a secure and isolated network environment. Security Groups provide network access control and can be used to limit access to certain services and ports. Network ACLs are used to control traffic in and out of the VPC.
Encryption is an essential tool to protect your data. AWS provides encryption services such as Key Management Service (KMS) and Server-Side Encryption (SSE).
Logging is an essential tool to monitor and audit system activity. AWS provides services such as CloudTrail and CloudWatch to collect, store, and monitor system activity.
AWS Shield is a service offered by AWS that protects against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. AWS Shield allows customers to customize their protection settings, create custom rules to protect their applications, and monitor their traffic to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks.
Amazon Inspector analyzes the application and its environment for security issues and provides a report detailing the findings. Inspector is used to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as missing patches, weak configuration settings, and insecure network protocols. Inspector can also detect malicious or suspicious activity, such as port scanning, attempted privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.
With AWS Config, customers can track changes to their resources and ensure they remain compliant with applicable regulations. Real-time visibility into their resource configuration helps customers detect misconfigurations and unauthorized modifications. AWS Config also includes customizable rulesets that ensure resources adhere to organizational standards and policies.
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) allows customers to quickly and easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for their applications. ACM also helps with the automatic renewal of certificates and support for the latest security protocols.
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure created by Microsoft for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides a wide range of security technologies to help protect your applications and data while they are stored, processed, and served in the cloud.
Microsoft Azure provides built-in security features such as encryption, authentication, authorization, and auditing to help protect your data and applications. It also offers a suite of security products and services to help you further protect your applications and data, including:
* Azure Active Directory (AD) for user authentication and identity management
* Azure Key Vault for managing and controlling access to cryptographic keys and other secrets
* Azure Security Center for monitoring and managing security across your Azure resources
* Azure Information Protection for classifying, labeling, and protecting sensitive data
* Azure App Service for securely hosting web and mobile applications
* Azure Network Security for protecting virtual networks
* Azure Security Services for detecting and responding to security threats
* Azure Advanced Threat Protection for detecting and responding to advanced threats
* Azure Backup for protecting data in the cloud
* Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery and business continuity
Google Cloud provides a range of security features to ensure the safety of your data. These include:
* Identity and Access Management (IAM) for role-based access control
* Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) for visibility and security posture management
* Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption key management
* Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for data protection
* Cloud Security Scanner for vulnerability assessment

## CERTIFICATIONS
As cloud usage increases, the need for appropriate training grows as well. Obtaining a certification in cloud computing is becoming an increasingly important step. There are two different types of certificates:
* Vendor certifications are earned through a specific vendor who validates a professional's ability to build, design and troubleshoot networks, applications, and other IT-related areas for a particular vendor.
* Industry certifications focus more on the overall industry and its technology. Industry certifications include certifications such as CompTIA A+ or Network+ and validate a professional's ability to troubleshoot hardware and software issues and build and maintain networks.
The key difference between vendor certifications and industry certifications is the focus. Vendor certifications are much more specific and focus on a particular vendor's products, while industry certifications are more general and focus on the larger IT industry. If you want to expand the area of IT you serve, here are some certifications to consider:
CISSP certification is a three-year certification that requires holders to maintain their knowledge and skills by participating in continuing education activities. Being certified ensures that individuals remain knowledgeable and up-to-date on the latest developments in the security field.
To be eligible for the CCSP certification, an individual must have at least five years of experience in IT security, with at least three years of experience in one or more of the six domains covered by the certification. The six domains include cloud concepts, architecture, design, operations, security, and legal and compliance. Upon completion of the exam, individuals will receive a certificate along with the listing on the Cloud Security Alliance's website.
The CISM Exam is a four-hour, 200-question exam administered by ISACA. The exam is divided into four domains: Information Security Governance (ISG), Information Risk Management and Compliance (IRMC), Information Security Program Development and Management (ISPDM), and Information Security Incident Management (ISIM).
It is essential to understand the exam structure and format. The exam consists of multiple-choice questions with a time limit of four hours. Each question is worth one point, and there is no penalty for incorrect answers.
To successfully pass, it's important to practice for the exam.
Many employers require CompTIA certification as a prerequisite for hiring or promoting IT professionals. Certificates are available in multiple levels, from entry-level to expert, and in various specialties, such as cloud, IT project management, mobile, and server. Each certification requires comprehensive study, hands-on experience, and passing one or more exams.
Remember that having more than one vendor certificate makes you very attractive in the increasingly popular multi-cloud world.
