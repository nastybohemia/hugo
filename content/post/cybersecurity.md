## FEARS OF STORING DATA IN THE CLOUD
Cloud computing can be an excellent opportunity for businesses, but it also introduces a new set of risks like data loss, unauthorized access, data theft, and malicious attacks. Organizations transitioning to the cloud could have some security and privacy concerns. 
The fear of running workloads in "someone else's data centers" is widespread, with many businesses and organizations concerned about the potential risks associated with such a task. This fear is understandable, as it often involves placing sensitive data and operations within the hands of a third party, which may sometimes have different levels of security and reliability than an organization would otherwise be able to provide for itself.
Furthermore, the potential for data breaches and other security issues is always a risk when outsourcing such operations. Companies must thoroughly vet any third-party data centers to ensure that they have the proper security protocols and processes in place to ensure that their data remains safe and secure.
Organizations should also take the time to consider their internal security measures and how these measures can be used to reduce the risks associated with outsourcing workloads to third-party data centers. These measures include setting up proper authentication and authorization systems and implementing encryption and other security protocols.
Running workloads in "someone else's data centers" is a risk. Still, with the proper security protocols and processes in place, organizations can protect themselves and their data from potential threats.
## BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD
Most cloud services provide a more secure environment than organizations' own data centers. Cloud providers have invested heavily in technology and personnel security to ensure that the data stored in their cloud environments are safe and secure. They also have in-depth knowledge of security best practices, allowing them to identify and respond to potential threats quickly.
On the other hand, organizations' own data centers often lack the resources necessary to implement robust security measures. Data centers may not have the personnel or technology to detect and respond to threats promptly, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Additionally, organizations can become overwhelmed with the sheer volume of data they need to protect, leading to security gaps and exploitation.
Overall, the cloud provides a more secure environment than organizations' own data centers due to the advanced security measures cloud providers have in place and their expertise in security best practices.
## OVERCOMING FEARS
By taking a proactive approach to learning security, organizations can ensure that their data is safe and secure in the cloud. Each public cloud vendor tends to have its own authorized classes. Below we will cover some tools you must get familiar with when working with the cloud services by Amazon, Microsoft, or Google.
AWS provides multiple services and features to help secure your applications and data. These include:
* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)
* Security Groups
* Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* Encryption
* Logging
* AWS Shield for DDoS protection
* Amazon Inspector for vulnerability scanning
* AWS Config for resource compliance
* AWS Certificate Manager for managing SSL/TLS certificates
