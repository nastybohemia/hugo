The book "American Government e3" says that election history has demonstrated that television advertising effectively garners voters' support. I believe that political advertising does manipulate the opinions of the masses. Otherwise, they would not be investing money in it.
####
Political advertising differs significantly from advertising consumer products and has additional regulations. For example, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) required candidates to include personal endorsements in their political ads. It also limited advertisements run by unions and corporations thirty days before a primary election and sixty days before a general election.
####
I believe that to have a political view, you need to know what each party/proposition represents. I saw good and bad political advertisements. I see it as good when it explains what this voting is about. Some time ago at the DMV, I saw ads that just plainly said, "Say YES to Prop 27". I think these advertisements are wrong. They give no context or information about the actual proposition. They just hammer in people's minds what to put in a ballot.
####
Political advertising is a powerful tool extensively used in elections to influence public opinion about issues and candidates. The reality of the US is that the population is being brainwashed daily. Most people are okay with it because it makes their life more accessible, and they don't have to overthink. Thinking is hard, research is complex, and the masses use advertisements as their mantra to save time (and money in their minds). It's not only advertising that manipulates decisions. It's culture, music, movies, the internet, bloggers, consumer products, etc.
If the social media platform does not correctly police what is factual in posts and advertisements, these outlets can become objects of manipulation, as in the 2016 election. The potential consequences of allowing such manipulation on social media platforms are highlighted, raising concerns about the impact on the democratic process.
Political advertising is part of a more extensive system of manipulation that includes culture, music, movies, the internet, and consumer products.
####
In a system that hinges on the idea of informed citizenry making choices based on genuine understanding, manipulation introduces a disconcerting element, when political attitudes are molded through various means, including advertising, the democratic process risks becoming a theatrical performance rather than a forum for informed decision-making.
####
The potential mockery of free elections lies not only in the manipulation itself but also in its consequences. If external actors or influential entities exert undue influence, it challenges the autonomy of the democratic process. This vulnerability can jeopardize the very foundation of democratic governance and create an environment where power is concentrated in the hands of those adept at manipulation.
####
In conclusion, political advertising is acknowledged as a powerful force that can manipulate public opinion. The essay has explored the distinctions between political and consumer advertising, discussed regulatory measures, and emphasized the importance of informed political views. The societal acceptance of manipulated messages is seen as a broader issue encompassing various aspects of culture. Additionally, the role of social media in shaping political discourse and the potential dangers of misinformation are crucial considerations for the health of democracy. As citizens, being vigilant consumers of information becomes imperative to preserve the integrity of free elections and ensure the democratic process remains untainted by manipulation.
