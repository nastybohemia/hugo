# Beginning of homelessness in the United States
Homelessness first became a national issue in the 1870s, with the Industrial
Revolution as a primary cause. A century later, the recession began to put the world into an
economic crisis. When Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1981, inflation and unemployment
rates were high. Rents in metro areas across the country have been increasing. At the same
time, wages have stagnated, and 40 years later, with various homeless initiatives in place,
many people in the United States are facing housing insecurity for the same reason.

Sam Tsemberis is the Founder and CEO of Pathways to Housing. A not-for-profit
organization founded in 1992 to provide immediate access to permanent regular market
apartments for people with significant mental health issues. He originated the Housing First
model, which became possible by getting funding from the Department of Mental Health.
####
Sam was driven by the necessity he saw to replace the “Staircase” model because he felt
these people had to prove they were worthy of housing. Housing First did not mean “housing
only.” Along with the housing, people were getting therapy and substance abuse support.
Sometimes people went to rehab before moving into an apartment.
####
Today, more than 40 percent of people experiencing homelessness in LA are
considered chronically homeless (see Fig. 2). LA County’s chronically homeless population
grew by more than 50 percent between 2019 and 2020 alone. At current growth rates, LA
could have a chronically homeless population the size of the city of Manhattan Beach by
2028.
## Advantages of “Housing First”
The “Housing First” program supporters believe that everybody deserves a home.
They have several arguments to back up their opinion. The first one is the reduction of
criminal justice system costs. Housing programs relieve the burden on law enforcement,
hospitals, and downtown areas. Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Obama said it’s “cheaper to solve homelessness than it is to put a band-aid on it.” Back in 2012, it cost “about $40,000 a year for a homeless person to be on
the streets”.
####
The second advantage of the program is the improvement of the nation’s health index
by providing homeless individuals with the stability necessary to tackle problems like mental
illness, substance abuse, and the trauma of jail time. Tents are known for spreading disease
and drug use. Removing people from the streets results in communities saving money by
preventing costly visits to hospitals, jails, and bail bonds.
####
The third benefit is reduced criminal activity. Homeless encampments on the streets
can indeed face challenges related to safety and illegal activity and are regularly troubled by
prostitution and violent crimes. Homeless individuals are often vulnerable to victimization
and exploitation due to their living conditions. Without adequate supervision or community
support, criminal activities become preventable.
####
The fourth benefit is in solving poverty-related issues by employment. It is
challenging to maintain a job when you must worry about where you will sleep tonight or
about the safety of your tent. The striving for esteem will only be successful when meeting
your vital and self-care needs.
####
The fifth benefit of using the program is avoiding legal challenges related to banning
sleeping and camping on sidewalks, panhandling, and giving food to homeless people in
public places. Often, these prohibitions may raise concerns about infringing on the First
Amendment rights of free speech and freedom of expression and challenging Fourth
Amendment grounds, which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures. If it can be
demonstrated that the laws disproportionately affect a particular group (such as homeless
individuals), they may be deemed discriminatory.
####
The final benefit of using “Housing First” is the zoning obstacle in increasing the
number of affordable. Zoning laws dictate how land can be used, what types of buildings can
be constructed, and where they can be located within a community. Zoning laws typically
involve complex approval processes that can be time-consuming and costly. Delays in
obtaining approvals can increase the overall development cost, making it financially
challenging for developers to create affordable housing. Zoning laws can vary significantly
from one jurisdiction to another. Inconsistencies in zoning regulations across neighboring
areas can complicate regional efforts to address affordable housing needs and create a
fragmented approach to development. Preconstruction time for an affordable project in LA
maybe 52 months, compared with 30 months for market-rate housing. Construction is also
expensive, averaging more than $550,000 per unit.
## Disadvantages of “Housing First”
One of the main objectives against “Housing First” program is that provided housing
is a short-term fix that only encourages dependency on the government. Some people even
call the program socialist.
####
The second disadvantage is the cost of the “Housing First” program. It requires
thousands of case and outreach workers, mental health, and activity specialists, building
rents, utilities, groceries, and supplies to make the program work. Instead of spending the
budget on shelter beds, the government could have focused on building new affordable
housing units and preserving current ones.
####
The third disadvantage is that the program does nothing to solve addiction. There are
numerous cases where, after getting into housing, homeless individuals were doing them
inside instead of outside. I find this video report on the internet by Kevin Dahlgren
hilariously sad. In the video, a woman describes her life in a Portland tent encampment. She
says: “It’s a piece of cake. That’s why there are so many out here. Because they feed you three meals a day, you don’t have to do anything but stay in your tent or party, or if you
smoke up a lot of dope, you can do that. That’s it. It’s like you wake up, you eat a blanche,
get high, eat a blanche for lunch, get high, eat dinner, get high. And that’s all you do. All day
long. Every day. I’m being honest.” Addiction and homelessness are inextricably linked, and
it takes more than a stable place to live to overcome the horrors of addiction.
####
The fourth disadvantage is that the benefit of free or reduced-fare housing discourages
people from taking high-paying jobs that would make them ineligible for the housing benefit.
In addition, the promise of housing for homeless people could encourage people to stay
homeless longer to qualify.
####
The fifth disadvantage is that increasing the number and quality of shelter beds could
contribute to the homelessness rate. This condition is possible in small towns, but cities like
Los Angeles or New York are far away from this fear because only about 36% of the people
seeking shelter get into one despite the number of shelter beds increasing by 80 percent from
2016 to 2022.
# Alternative Programs
The “Staircase” System for getting into housing where you start at the bottom was
designed in the 1980s and early 1990s. Level one is a shelter, and as you fulfill specific
requirements like being sober or taking meds, you can get into a dormitory; after that, you
could start sharing an apartment with a few other people. The top of the staircase has your
apartment in the building with other former homeless people. The idea behind the “staircase”
was to get people ready for housing.
####
“Community First!” is a nonprofit-operated community outside Austin, Texas, that
provides cheap housing to formerly homeless tenants but requires them to pay some rent,
undergo criminal background checks, and abide by various rules as examples to emulate.
Prevention and Diversion Programs like COVID-19 rent relief focus on preventing
individuals and families from becoming homeless in the first place. This can involve financial
assistance, mediation, or other interventions to keep people in their current housing or find
alternative housing solutions.
# Conclusion: My Experience
In today’s American housing crisis, finding a practical and comprehensive approach
to resolving the problem of homelessness remains challenging. In the United States, in the
economics of competition, we must increase our budget every time the concentration of
opportunity rises. About 40% of Americans spend over 35% of their income on rent (see Fig.
1).
####
I have chosen this topic for my research because I currently live in a transitional
living program. For about three years, I’ve been experiencing safety issues at my residences,
in neighborhoods considered one of the safest in California. These invasion problems would
cause me discomfort and the urge to move out. Staying with friends wasn’t an option for me
because a lot of my friends in Los Angeles struggle with some addiction, and it feels like I
cannot depend on their daily mind quarks or mood swings. It was possible to live a hotel life
when I wasn’t in school. I didn’t want to drop out, so a couple of months ago, I gathered
resources available for young adults, those under the age of 25, and started my journey of
getting help from The Los Angeles County Coordinated Entry System to continue my
education.
####
Getting housed is usually what staff calls “a waiting game.” Fortunately for me, as
soon as I arrived at the shelter and did the interview, they had a room with one other
roommate available. In this program, it’s not just that you get a roof over your head and show
up for curfew; you have to figure out the rest on your own. This program is provided by the
