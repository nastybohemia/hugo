Defining the values Americans tend to share is akin to unraveling a complex and diverse tapestry woven by the threads of history, culture, and individual beliefs. While there are overarching principles that resonate across the nation, the diversity within American society also gives rise to passionate disagreements about the proper role of government in upholding these values.
####
To answer the question about which values Americans tend to share, I would like to define the essence of being an American. America is a multinational, multiracial country. Often, white kids in America have a particular lament of not having an ethnicity, identity, and culture that, for example, black kids have. 
####
Many of this country's second or third generations speak American, not English, but American. That is a language combined with a brown tongue in which there are German, Yiddish, and lots of Spanish words. The brilliance of the United States is that it allows you to change its culture. Music, religion, food, language, and hobbies cannot change in other cultures. But America is all about changing your culture. Cultural gaps are at the heart of what it means to be an American.

Here are five main American Values I noticed over the six years I lived here:
* Independence and self-determination: the individual is responsible for shaping his or her own identity and destiny through one's choices, abilities, and efforts. Independence fosters one's ability to be self-sufficient and to be able to do what is necessary to create a fulfilling life for oneself and one's family.
* Meritocracy: allows for upward socioeconomic mobility based on one's efforts, accomplishments, and talents, and not through seniority, inherited names, titles or property, or unethical means such as bribery.
* Informality: Americans use relatively few titles in everyday interactions, reserving them for medical and religious professionals, military and police officers, and university professors.
* Directness: let's just say most Americans are not very poetic. There is danger in romanticism, so they use unambiguous language.
* Consumerism: everybody seems to be okay with the fact that holidays are in place only for corporations to make more money on seasonal goods.

Country music, national parks, cowboys, horses, and guns are symbols of American Wilderness. All Americans from East to West have patriotism rooted in their culture: statements such as America is the greatest country in the world.
####
Most people believe there is a crisis of values. They look upon rising levels of crime, high levels of drug abuse, high levels of out-of-wedlock births, and high rates of divorce as symptoms of a profound government failure to uphold American values. 
####
In the diverse tapestry of American values, some threads, such as independence, meritocracy, and patriotism, bind the nation together. However, the disagreements about the proper role of government reflect the ongoing tension between individualism and collective responsibility. Recognizing and understanding these differing perspectives is essential for fostering a constructive dialogue that can lead to policies aligning with the shared values at the core of the American experience. In navigating this dynamic landscape, finding common ground becomes crucial for the nation's unity and progress.
