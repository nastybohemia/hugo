## The Bleeding Edge (2016)
This is a live-action film based on actual events about how the state of China sells people who do not support communism for organs. These people are not protesting.
They are not against the political regime. They believe in Falun Dafa, a peaceful cultivation practice based on meditation.
Communism implies the rejection of religions. Thus people practicing meditation become their enemies. The Chinese system is very similar to Gulag in the USSR: the secret police pick you up from your home and take you away in an unknown direction. After that, the torture begins with needles under the nails, an electric shocker, boiling water with soda poured through the funnel into the stomach, or a gang bang of ten.
Today, more than 1,000 institutions in China deal with human organ transplants, primarily illegal. This is how it works: doctors from the hospitals call the prisons and ask for a new donor, which they are happy to provide from among the so-called "political prisoners."
You probably still don't know anything about this movie because it's banned in China, and no one wants to ruin relations with China. "We have connections with China," - the distributor answered. I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to know the truth.
## The Shape of Water (2017)
"The Shape of Water" is leading BAFTA with 12 nominations. I firmly believe this is because of the movie quotes. Guillermo del Toro represented the main character (Elisa) in the same way as Amélie by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Both women feel difficulties in contact with other people. They live in their own world of dreams and fantasy. Both work in the services sector with low-paid jobs, but they find something more than stereotypical monetary values. They find love in their lives, the only person who can understand them with all their strangeness and unusualness. They're not just waiting when the guy will ask them on a date. These women are fighting for their love; they're looking for it, hunting, spying, and committing crimes.
