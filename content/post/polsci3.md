The federal government is the big picture and the state government is its pixels upon which the whole picture is dependent. Resolving a parking ticket or getting a dump sticker are those times when citizens get to interact with the local government. Local government matters the very most because it controls citizens’ schools, hospitals, libraries, roads, bridges, cemeteries, water systems, parks, and public systems. The officials who determine the most are usually within walking distance in an ugly public building.

These officials create laws that sometimes have unintended negative consequences. Many laws that are not related to the penal code are penalties for the poor. Fines for minor infractions tend to unfairly penalize low-income residents. Unpaid traffic tickets turn into thousands of dollars and suspended driver’s licenses. In California's traffic system, you pay more for being poor. The average cost for improper parking is very not proportionate to the minimum wage.

There are pros and cons to giving more power to the federal government to form greater uniformity among the states. Some of the pros are:
* One benefit of federal government policy enforcement is that if you fail to attain a desired policy goal at the local level, you can offset this policy by successfully securing it at the federal level.
* Another benefit of the federal government policy enforcement is the proper funding of the policy through grants. Sometimes it might not seem like enough but the federal budget has much greater capacities than the local budget.
####
The negative side of giving power more power to the federal government are:
* The difference in the number of elected officials who can make the calls. There are only around five hundred seats in the federal government while there are at least half a million seats in the local government. So, it is more likely to meet someone at the level of local government who can enforce a policy. At the same time, this difference in numbers makes it difficult to get everyone on the same page because it’s still necessary to have an election for policy approval on the level of local government.
* In addition to that, each region or state has its unique features which are known only to the people in that environment. There are states which tend to be more democratic or republican. Each state has its minimum wage limits, crime rates, and population spread. All these numbers are crucial when deciding on the necessary policies.
####
In my opinion, the federal government has enough power to control local policies. I don’t see that it needs any more power to make the quality of life of civilians any better. Lately, California had some great bills passed like the Death To The Pink Tax which prohibits businesses from charging a different price for two goods based on their marketed gender. It’s known that oftentimes companies would charge higher prices for the razors marketed for women. I think there should be a policy in place that determines prices of fines based on the income level and that is not standard for everyone. Unfair penalization of low-income residents should end. People with income in higher brackets should feel a similar financial burden as those who are in the lower income categories.
