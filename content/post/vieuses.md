Computer viruses have been around for almost as long as computers themselves. The first known computer virus, the Creeper virus, was detected in 1971. 
Since then, the computer virus industry has progressed significantly and has become an established part of the computing landscape.
Some viruses pose a significant threat to the computer security of data centers which are the backbone of modern businesses. This article covers the top 10 viruses that nearly destroyed data centers worldwide.
# Melissa
The Melissa computer virus is a macro virus that was first detected in 1999. The virus is designed to replicate itself and send itself to contacts in the user's address book. Once opened, the virus will infect the user's computer, causing it to crash and potentially damage any documents stored on the computer. It is spread via email, usually as an attachment.
The Melissa virus was one of the first widely spread computer viruses. It caused system overloads in some of the world's largest data centers causing massive disruption to businesses that relied on these data centers. It was estimated that the virus caused over $20 million in damages worldwide.
# LoveLetter
The LoveLetter worm was created by a Filipino programmer and released in May 2000. The original email containing the LoveLetter worm had the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and an attachment called "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs." When the user opened the attachment, the LoveLetter worm was activated and began to spread to other computers.
The LoveLetter worm caused significant damage to computers around the world. The worm could delete files and overwrite existing files, and this caused computers to crash and even caused some computer systems to become unusable. In addition, the LoveLetter worm could steal user information, such as passwords and other personal data, which could be used to access accounts and steal money. The virus spread by sending itself to every contact in the user's address book.
# Code Red
Code Red was a worm that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Windows operating system, first discovered in mid-2001 by a group of security researchers.
The direct impact of Code Red was disruption. It was quickly found to be a powerful type of malware due to its ability to spread itself rapidly and infect vulnerable systems. It was capable of taking over computers and using them to send large amounts of malicious data, which could cause networks to become overwhelmed and crash. It was also found to be particularly destructive, as it was capable of deleting large amounts of data from infected computers, potentially resulting in significant data loss.
It was designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft's IIS web server and was spread by scanning for open ports. Once the worm had infected a system, it would scan for other vulnerable computers and replicate itself.
It quickly spread, infecting hundreds of thousands of computers in just a few hours. It caused outages and other disruptions to data centers worldwide, resulting in millions of dollars in lost productivity, data restoration costs, and other related expenses.
The response to Code Red was swift and effective, with security researchers creating and sharing updated antivirus software to protect against it. Despite this, it still managed to cause significant damage and disruption, with some estimates suggesting it had infected over 359,000 computers by the end of 2001.
The Code Red Worm was a wake-up call for Microsoft. After the infection, it implemented changes to its security practices, including increasing its focus on patching vulnerabilities and issuing security advisories. Microsoft also implemented measures to help users protect their systems, such as providing more secure software and better security tools.
# SQL Slammer
The SQL Slammer virus, also known as Sapphire, is a computer worm that quickly spread across the Internet on January 25, 2003. It caused tremendous damage to computers running Microsoft Windows operating systems, and the effects of its attack are still felt today
The SQL Slammer virus was mainly focused on computers running Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems. The virus spread quickly and was able to infect nearly 75,000 computers in 10 minutes. The virus caused tremendous damage to the Windows operating system, with reports of computers crashing, systems freezing, and data being corrupted. As a result, businesses were forced to shut down, and the cost of restoring computers was estimated in millions of dollars.
The virus was able to spread so quickly due to a vulnerability in the way Windows handled SQL Server. By exploiting this vulnerability, the virus was able to spread rapidly and cause a great deal of damage.
In response to the SQL Slammer attack, Microsoft quickly released patches to fix the vulnerability and prevent further damage. The company also released a tool to detect and remove the virus from Windows computers. Microsoft also took steps to ensure that similar attacks would not happen in the future, and the company implemented several security protocols to protect Windows operating systems.
# Storm Trojan
The Storm Trojan virus has been malicious software affecting computers since 2007. It is a form of malware that has been used to infect computers and networks, causing various malicious activities such as stealing personal information, redirecting users to malicious websites, and taking control of users' computer systems. It is spread through malicious emails, websites, and other methods of malicious software distribution. It is often used as part of an enormous cyber-attack, where the attackers can use the stolen information for their gain.
# Conficker
The Conficker worm, also known as Downup, Downadup, and Kido, was first discovered in November 2008 and is believed to have been created by an organized criminal group. It spread quickly, infecting millions of computers in home and corporate networks. The worm was highly sophisticated, taking advantage of several weaknesses in the Windows operating system. The Conficker worm exposed several vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords and open ports. It also took advantage of a vulnerability in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used for file and printer sharing. 
As the worm's creator remains a mystery, it is difficult to assign responsibility for the damage it has caused. Despite being over a decade old, the Conficker worm is still a threat today. It remains active and can still infect computers if the proper security measures are not taken. It has also spawned several variants, which can be even more challenging to detect and remove.
# The Stuxnet
The Stuxnet virus is a malicious computer worm discovered in June 2010, designed to disrupt industrial processes, particularly those in Iran's nuclear facilities. It is believed to be the first malware to target industrial infrastructure and is considered a sophisticated example of cyber warfare.
Stuxnet is a self-replicating computer worm that spreads through computer networks via USB drives, exploiting security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. It can infect industrial control systems, such as those used to control nuclear power plants. Once infected, the worm can manipulate the system's programming to disrupt operations and cause physical damage to the machinery.
Stuxnet is remarkably sophisticated and intended to infect industrial control systems. It can then modify the system's programming to achieve its goals without being detected.
The effects of the Stuxnet virus were far-reaching. In Iran, it caused extensive damage to its nuclear program and significant setbacks. It was also the first example of a successful attack on industrial infrastructure, raising the specter of cyber warfare for the first time.
The implications of the Stuxnet virus are still being felt today. It served as a wake-up call to the world that sophisticated cyberattacks could be used to target industrial infrastructure, and it has spurred increased efforts to secure such systems.
# Cryptolocker
Cryptolocker was first discovered in 2013 as a type of malicious software (or "malware") that is used to encrypt files on a computer, rendering them inaccessible. Once the virus has been installed, it begins to encrypt all of the files on the computer, including documents, photos, and other vital data. It then demands a ransom from the user in exchange for the decryption key. If the user does not pay the ransom, their files remain encrypted, and they may never be able to reaccess them.
# Trickbot
The Trickbot virus is malware that has been around since 2016 to steal personal and financial information from computer systems. It does this by taking control of the system and using various techniques to steal data, such as keylogging, form-grabbing, and remote access.
Form-grabbing works by monitoring web forms as they are being filled out and then capturing the data before it is encrypted and sent. This data is then used to access sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial information, and other confidential data.
The virus is most commonly spread through malicious emails, websites, and other types of malicious software. It has become increasingly dangerous to computer systems and has caused significant security issues for many organizations.
# Ryuk
The Ryuk virus is a form of ransomware that has been wreaking havoc on computer systems since August 2018. It is a dangerous virus that encrypts data and demands a ransom payment to restore it.
Malicious email attachments, phishing links, and malicious websites spread the virus. The virus is also spread through malicious software, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
It has been linked to several high-profile cyberattacks, including the infiltration of the networks of newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. It is believed to have been developed by a criminal organization to extort money from victims.
